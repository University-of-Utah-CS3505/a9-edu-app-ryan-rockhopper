# Educational App Overview

Our team developed an educational program that teaches the danger of distracted driving. The program will be in a form of a game that uses a cat-and-mouse
metaphor and is developed using an engine called Box2D.

# How-to

A player will be able to control a mouse that has the ability to move left & right. The goal of the game is to try and survive as long as possible by
dodging the incoming cats, however, once in a while you will receive a pop-up simulating texting that requires you to type in a certain word to be rid
of it. While this is happening, the game will still continue to play in the background and you won't have any control over your mouse. As the game progresses,
cats will come at you at a faster pace and pop-ups will require you to type in longer queries. Once you lose, the screen will fade to black as it shows you
your statistics and how it correlates to how quick an accident can happen if you get distracted and lose focus when driving.

# Lesson to be Learned

The primary goal of this game is not winning, rather, it tries to convey the message that you sholdn't lose focus when driving. 
While you're playing you will find that you have no control over your mouse and cannot dodge the cats effectively whenever a pop-up
appears on screen. This will relate back to how you cannot drive well while distracted, as the game is ultimately designed to teach
about the dangers against distracted driving. Further, your time survived indicates how quickly an accident can happen even if you 
just get distracted by a split second.

## Comments to Evaluators

Box2D was utilized to give the mouse the ability to move left and right smoothly without gliding around, it's also used to give
the cats the ability to come towards you at a certain speed while also having the ability to turn at a random angle as they desire.
Last, we also used Box2D to create the game world and have it generate enemies at a pace.

## Branches

We utilized branches whenever we wrote our code, each team member made a branch for a paticular feature. Most of the work 
was done in seperate branches so that conflicts could be avoided and each member can modify and test the functionality they worked
on without having to worry about breaking the main branch's or other's code.
